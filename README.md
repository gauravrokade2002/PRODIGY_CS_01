# PRODIGY_CS_01
Caesar Cipher
GitHub:gauravrokade2002 

Python program that can encrypt text using the Caesar cipher  algorithm. allow user to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and description




1. Run this source code in vs-code or python.
2. Select the desired direction E or D (encode or decode)
3. Enter your text message.
4. Enter the shift value (positive for encryption, negative for decryption).

you will get a output, whenever you want to decrypt your message send your shift key and decrypted message with same code message can be decrypted.







# Encryption is the process of converting plaintext (readable data) into ciphertext (unreadable data) using an algorithm and an encryption key. This ensures that only authorized parties with the correct decryption key can access the original information. Encryption is widely used to protect sensitive data, such as financial transactions, personal information, and communications over the internet.

# Decryption is the reverse process, where ciphertext is converted back into plaintext using a decryption key. This allows authorized users to read the original data.

Key Points:
Encryption: Converts plaintext to ciphertext.
Decryption: Converts ciphertext back to plaintext.
Purpose: To protect data from unauthorized access.

Real-Life Examples:
WhatsApp Messaging: Uses end-to-end encryption to ensure that only the sender and recipient can read the messages.
HTTPS Websites: Encrypt user data to prevent interception by third parties.
Encrypted Email Services: Services like ProtonMail protect email contents through encryption123.

# The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher named after Julius Caesar, who used it to protect his private correspondence. It works by shifting each letter in the plaintext a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

How It Works:

# Shift: Each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3:

Plaintext: HELLO
Ciphertext: KHOOR

Shift of 3:
Plaintext: ABC
Ciphertext: DEF

Characteristics:
Simplicity: Easy to understand and implement.
Security: Very basic and easily broken with modern techniques12.
